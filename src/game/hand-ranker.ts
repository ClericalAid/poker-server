/**
 * HandRanker
 * Takes in 7 cards, and then computes the value of said hand.
 *
 * Member variables:
 * constants:
 * All constants are from strongest to weakest, high to low
 * STRAIGHT_FLUSH - The strength of a straight flush compared to the other possible hands
 * QUAD - The strength of a quadruple matched hand
 * FULL_HOUSE - The strength of a full house
 * FLUSH - flush
 * STRAIGHT - straight
 * TRIPLE - triple
 * TWO_PAIR - two pair
 * PAIR - pair
 * HIGH_CARD - Your hand has none of the above
 * HAND_SIZE - We are only dealing with 7 cards. If we go above that, something is terribly wrong
 *
 * ACE - The number associated with ace, which is 14. King is 13, queen is 12, etc.
 *
 * Card organizers:
 * cardValueHistogram - A histogram counting how often each hand rank occurs in our hand. For
 *    example, if our hand consisted of:
 *    4C, 4D, 7H, 7C, 5C, 6S, 8H 
 *    the card histogram would read as:
 *    4 - 2
 *    5 - 1
 *    6 - 1
 *    7 - 2
 *    8 - 1
 *    It only cares about the value, not the suits. This is useful for finding full houses,
 *    two pair, straights, etc.
 * allCards - Literally a list of all the cards that are part of the hand. More of a debugging
 *    variable at this point I think.
 * spades - The values of all of the spades in our hand. The hearts, clubs, and diamonds array
 *    are all of a similar functionality to this variable.
 *    For example, if our hand was:
 *    4C, 4D, 7H, 7C, 5C, 6S, 8H 
 *    The spades array would be:
 *    6
 *    The hearts array would be:
 *    7, 8
 *    The clubs array would be:
 *    4, 7, 5
 *    The diamonds array would be:
 *    4
 * hearts - Similar to the spades array. Refer to the spades variable for more info.
 * clubs - Similar to the spades array. Refer to the spades variable for more info.
 * diamonds - Similar to the spades array. Refer to the spades variable for more info.
 * allSuits - Simply all of the suit arrays pushed into this one array. This makes it easier
 *    to loop through all of the suits.
 * handRank - The "rank" of the hand, referring to straight flush, quad, full house, etc.
 * handValue - How strong the hand is within its rank. For example, if we had a quad that
 *    consisted of quad 4 with an ace kicker, the handValue would be:
 *    4, 14
 * handScore - The total score of the hand. The handRank concatenated with the handValue. For
 *    example, quad 4 with ace kicker will be:
 *    8, 4, 14

   *        possible.
   *
   * 3) If we have an ace, check for a, 2, 3, 4, 5

   * 4) Two pair

   *
   * CORNER CASES:
   * When there's a quad and pair on the board, choosing the best kicker is tricky. This is because

   * 4, 4

   * call it a day and assume we have selected the best hand. But these corner cases ruin it.
   * Luckily, there is an easy fix. If there is a two pair, or a quad, then we need to sort the
   * remaining cards by value, regardless of their pairing. This approach scales checking for hands
   * even if there are more than 7 cards. Don't know if that's useful though.
